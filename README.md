## Description

OOTD Inspo app is a full-stack application that allows users to view fashion items and gain inspiration for their own personal style. A user has the ability to view products, photos, or styles uploaded by other users and post their own items. They can also edit anyone's post to add product information such as the brand, price, details, and a link to purchase the item. A user does not need to sign up for OOTD Inspo App to use it, however once a user joins they have access to save items to their own personal Collection. 

## Technologies Used

OOTD Inspo app was built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, EJS, JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS. Animista was also used for CSS animations.

## Approach Taken



## Using OOTD Inspo App

The Index page of OOTD Inspo will display all images of posted fashion items. They are not categorized by anything. This gives a user the ability to browse everything the app has to offer if they want. The navigation gives a user the choice to switch to browse by season, add an item, or sign up/login. If a user choses to shop by season they will be taken to a separate page with items that have been tagged for each season. A user can add any item that inspires them or any item they want to purchase to OOTD Inspo app. The only key value that is required is the image, so additional details are not needed and are encouraged to be completed by other users if they have them. If someone choses to sign up for OOTD Inspo app, they are able to add items to their own personal collection. 

## Unsolved Problems

I did not have time to complete the Collection route. At this time no matter who is signed in anything that has been checked as collect will show up in the My Collections route.
